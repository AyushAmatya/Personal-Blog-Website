						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology is a body of knowledge devoted to creating tools, processing actions and the extracting of materials. The term "Technology" 
						is wide, and everyone has their way of understanding its meaning. We use technology to accomplish various tasks in our daily lives, in brief;
						we can describe technology as products and processes used to simplify our daily lives. We use technology to extend our abilities, making people
						the most crucial part of any technological system. </p>

						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is also an application of science used to solve problems. But it is vital to know that technology and science are 
						different subjects which work hand-in-hand to accomplish specific tasks or solve problems.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We apply technology in almost everything we do in our daily lives; we use technology at work, we use technology for communication, 
						transportation, learning, manufacturing, securing data, scaling businesses and so much more.  Technology is human knowledge which involves
						tools, materials, and systems. The application of technology typically results in products. If technology is well applied, it benefits humans,
						but the opposite is true, if used for malicious reasons.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businesses are using technology to stay competitive; they create new products and services using technology, and they also use 
						technology to deliver those products and services to their customers on time and within budget. There are various impact of technology that
						affects the daily lives.</p>

					<div class="text1">
						<img src="img/b.png" width="490px" height="280px">
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology has had a great impact on agriculture. The productivity and yield of goods have increased, and at the same time,
						it has proved to be profitable for the farmers. Nutritional value of crops has now increased, and plants are no more prone to
						diseases. Now our farmers no more depend on rainfall, they have pumps to irrigate their fields. Thus, the price of food items has 
						gone down significantly. Scientists have prepared better DNAs of plants which are powerful enough to sustain any attack. Technology
						has primarily impacted this sector.</p>

						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the use of different pesticides and insecticides have killed various living organisms and degraded the soil. 
						Use of pesticides have numerous negative health effects in workers who apply them, people that line nearby the area of application or
						downstream/downwind from it, and consumers who eat the pesticides which remain on their food.</p>

					<div class="text1">
						<img src="img/d.png" width="490px" height="280px">
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With technology, communication is easy; even in cases when you want to convey something urgently to someone, mobiles 
						and emails come in handy. Technology has made it easy to keep in touch with old contacts and has strengthened relationships. Finding a
						date was never so easy, thanks to the dating and chatting websites! Technology is behind the success of long-distance relationships. 
						Advancements in the modes of communication have promoted faster decision-making and led to the development and progress of the world. Most
						businesses depend on technology for communication. For example, videoconferencing has made it possible to give the best education to
						students via expert faculty on the web.</p>

						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many teenagers are always hooked to the social networking sites. They are closer to online friends, but the gap between
						parents and kids has increased considerably. Communication is lacking, as parents are not techno-savvy to the communication styles of the
						kids, increasing the generation gap. Many people abuse social networking sites and communicate with unsuspecting victims pretending to be
						someone else. This tendency has done more harm than good.</p>

						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's students not only have computers to help them with their schoolwork, they have easy access to research tools
						while teachers use technology to enhance the impact of their lessons. Students can easily do the research work without making more effort.
						The modernization of education helps to make the education more practicable with the use of many devices which helps to improve the education.
						It has also made easier to make online leaning for various courses and get online degree.</p>

						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How ever the younger students get attracted to the negative aspects of it. The negative side is that the Internet is very
						firmly entrenched in the lives of pupils and students and, thus, students have very little contact with teachers and university professors.
						Even graduate works today are not brought to a consultation with the teacher but are sent by e-mail. A teacher after checking in the same way 
						submits the work to a student with all editâ€™s corrections. This option allows you to save time and effort to travel to the university or college,
						do not require that teachers spending their free time for a meeting with the student.</p>

						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's world, technology plays an important role in every industry as well as in our personal lives. Areas like biotechnology,
						pharmaceuticals, information technology, the development of medical devices and equipment, and more have all made significant contributions to improving 
						the health of people all around the world. From "small" innovations like adhesive bandages and ankle braces, to larger, more complex technologies like
						MRI machines, artificial organs, and robotic prosthetic limbs, technology has undoubtedly made an incredible impact on medicine. This have helped to

						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology can have a large impact on users' mental and physical health. Being overly connected can cause psychological issues such

						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;New transportation technologies are rising to meet these difficulties, including connected and autonomous vehicles, elective fuels,
						keyless armada management and movement examination, and also nearby zoning and arranging arrangements that bolster travel situated improvement.
						New technology for on-street interchanges will significantly change how vehicles work and give information and capacities to better, continuous
